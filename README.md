# Next.js with Reown Template

This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/tree/canary/packages/create-next-app), integrated with [Reown](https://www.walletconnect.com/) (previously WalletConnect) for seamless multi-chain wallet connection. It's an ideal starting point for building web applications requiring integration with EVM chains, Solana, and Bitcoin.

## Features

- **Next.js 15**: Leverage the latest features of Next.js for fast, efficient, and scalable web development.
- **Reown Integration**: Easy and user-friendly wallet connection, supporting EVM chains, Solana, and Bitcoin.
- **Shadcn/UI Support**: Leverage beautifully styled and accessible UI components.
- **Ethers.js v6**: A powerful and lightweight library for Ethereum interaction.
- **Wagmi**: Simplified hooks and utilities for Ethereum developers.
- **TypeChain**: Strongly-typed smart contract interaction for TypeScript enthusiasts.
- **Font Optimization**: Utilizes [`next/font`](https://nextjs.org/docs/basic-features/font-optimization) for optimized loading of the Inter font, a popular Google Font.
- **Development Ready**: Quick setup with support for various package managers (npm, yarn, pnpm, bun).

## Wallet Connection: Default vs Custom

### Default Reown (AppKit) Wallet Connection

Reown provides a default wallet connection method through its AppKit:

- One-click wallet connection
- Supports multiple chains out of the box
- Minimal configuration required
- Use the default `<appkit-button />` component

### Custom Wallet Connection

Our custom implementation offers:

- More control over the UI and connection flow
- Custom styling and interaction
- Additional features like network switching, address copying, etc.
- Toasts and user-friendly feedback

## Wallet Connection Hooks

### Location

All wallet-related hooks are located in `app/hooks/wallet/`:

1. **useWalletConnection**

   - Primary hook for wallet connection
   - Supports both default and custom connection types
   - Provides methods to open wallet connection
   - Renders connection buttons with different types

   ```typescript
   const { appKit, address, openWalletConnection, WalletConnection } =
     useWalletConnection();
   ```

   - Types:
     - `"default"`: Only AppKit button
     - `"custom"`: Only custom button
     - `"both"`: Both connection methods

2. **useGetAccountSettings**

   - Retrieves account-specific information
   - Fetches balance, network, and connection status
   - Provides action buttons for crypto operations

   ```typescript
   const { address, isConnected, caipNetwork, balance, actionButtons } =
     useGetAccountSettings();
   ```

3. **useGetActivity**

   - Fetches wallet activity events
   - Converts events to an easily consumable array

   ```typescript
   const { activities } = useGetActivity();
   ```

4. **useGetCustomTokens**

   - Manages custom token lists
   - Supports loading and processing tokens

   ```typescript
   const { tokens, isLoading } = useGetCustomTokens(initialTokens);
   ```

5. **useGetNetwork**

   - Handles network selection and switching
   - Provides search and filter functionality for networks

   ```typescript
   const { caipNetwork, searchQuery, filteredNetworks, handleNetworkSwitch } =
     useGetNetwork();
   ```

6. **useGetWalletDetails**

   - Comprehensive wallet details management
   - Handles view navigation, balance, and responsive design

   ```typescript
   const { view, address, balance, navigateTo, handleCopyAddress } =
     useGetWalletDetails();
   ```

7. **useGetWalletHeader**
   - Provides wallet header-specific functionalities
   - Handles address copying and disconnection
   ```typescript
   const { address, handleCopyAddress, handleDisconnect } =
     useGetWalletHeader();
   ```

## Chain Management

### Chain Images and Configuration

#### Location

- Chain-related configurations are in `app/providers/` directory
- Chain images management in `utils/chainImages.ts`

#### Adding Chains

1. **Wagmi Configuration** (`app/providers/wagmi.ts`):

   - Configure supported networks
   - Define chain details (ID, name, RPC URLs)

   ```typescript
   import { defineChain } from "wagmi/chains";

   export const customChain = defineChain({
     id: 12345,
     name: "Custom Network",
     nativeCurrency: { name: "Custom Token", symbol: "CSTM", decimals: 18 },
     rpcUrls: {
       default: { http: ["https://custom-rpc-url.com"] },
     },
   });
   ```

2. **Chain Images** (`utils/chainImages.ts`):
   - Centralized location for chain logo images
   - Supports matching images by chain ID
   - Easy to extend and customize
   ```typescript
   export const getChainImage = (chainId: number) => {
     const chainImages: Record<number, string> = {
       1: "/images/chains/ethereum.png",
       // Add more chain images
     };
     return chainImages[chainId] || "/images/chains/default.png";
   };
   ```

### Custom Chains

- Easily add custom networks
- Supports both standard and unique blockchain configurations
- Integrate with Wagmi and Reown seamlessly
