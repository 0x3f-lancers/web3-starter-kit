# Next.js with RainbowKit Template

This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/tree/canary/packages/create-next-app), integrated with [RainbowKit](https://www.rainbowkit.com/) for seamless wallet connection. It's an ideal starting point for building web applications requiring Ethereum wallet integration.

## Features

- **Next.js 15**: Leverage the latest features of Next.js for fast, efficient, and scalable web development.
- **RainbowKit Integration**: Easy and user-friendly wallet connection, supporting a wide range of Ethereum wallets.
- **Shadcn/UI Support**: Leverage beautifully styled and accessible UI components.
- **Ethers.js v6**: A powerful and lightweight library for Ethereum interaction.
- **Wagmi**: Simplified hooks and utilities for Ethereum developers.
- **TypeChain**: Strongly-typed smart contract interaction for TypeScript enthusiasts.
- **Font Optimization**: Utilizes [`next/font`](https://nextjs.org/docs/basic-features/font-optimization) for optimized loading of the Inter font, a popular Google Font.
- **Development Ready**: Quick setup with support for various package managers (npm, yarn, pnpm, bun).

## Getting Started

To get started, clone the repository and install the dependencies:

```bash
